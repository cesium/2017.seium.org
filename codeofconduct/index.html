      This set of rules must be followed throughout the entire event, both at the conference and other
      conference-related social events.

      We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and
      imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks and workshops.
      Conference participants violating these rules may be expelled from the conference.
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability,
      physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
      intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks
      or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

    <div class="text col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

      Exhibitors in the sponsor booths and speakers, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-
      harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors and speakers should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
      Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
      otherwise create a sexualised environment. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the
      conference organisers
       may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
      or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
      concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
      Conference staff can be identified by their t-shirts.
